For this project I will be deconstructing an existing web page and then rebuilding it. To do this I will be utilizing Chrome's Dev Tools and my knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Once I've completed the project I will add more info about how I got there, what toold I found helpful, where I struggled, and what I learned throughout the process.
