For this project I will be deconstructing an existing web page and then rebuilding it. To do this I will be utilizing Chrome's Dev Tools and my knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Once I've completed the project I will add more info about how I got there, what I found helpful, where I struggled, and what I learned throughout the process.

Final Thoughts:
I really had trouble getting through this project because I often found myself discouraged when things didn't match perfectly to the actual Google homepage. My perfectionists tendencies definitely got in my way and I avoided working on this for a week because I hated feeling like I just couldn't get things right.

My biggest hurdle was figuring out how to display things (especially the top and bottom nav bars that were split in 2 parts, but still needed to be in the same row.). Eventually I just gave up on using flexbox for the whole project and found that grid was just what I needed. Being able to map things out precisely in grid really helped me draw things out and feel a lot more incontrol than just using flexbox and hoping that things would work out. I feel like using grid for the barebones of my display and then tweaking items with flexbox is my preferred way of doing things.

One thing that I need to work on moving forward is committing often. I really didn't do much in this project and it's something that I have to get in the habit of doing.

Overall I'm really proud of how this project came out and I'm happy that I was able to return to it with a clearer head and work through the difficulties I ran into.
